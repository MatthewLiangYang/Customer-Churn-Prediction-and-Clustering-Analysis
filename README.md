Customer Churn Prediction and Clustering Analysis
Background:

There is intense competition among online video service providers. To increase revenue, businesses need more subscribers, but retaining existing customers is more important than acquiring new ones. Therefore, businesses want to identify which customers are likely to cancel their subscriptions, i.e., customer churn. If they can predict who is likely to churn, they may be able to retain them through promotional offers.

Overview:

This dataset collects customer-related data regarding video service usage and labels whether a customer has churned or not. Based on this dataset, this project will build a KNN classification model to predict customer churn. Additionally, all customers labeled as "churned" will undergo K-Means clustering analysis. Using pyecharts, we will visualize the results and finally propose targeted strategies for different types of churned customers.
